Create a simple React component called Blink that renders a **span** with a text passed as a child.
The text must be visible during one second, then hidden during one second, visible again during one second, and so on. To hide the text, you must use the css property **visibility: hidden.**

For example:
> <Blink>Hello Edube!</Blink>
