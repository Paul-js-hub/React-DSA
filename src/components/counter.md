The component is not behaving properly.

Create a React component named Counter which should display:
- an interger, starting at 0, in an element with id = 'value
- a button with id = 'increment' which increments a 'value' when you click on it
- a button with id = 'decrement' which decrements a 'value' when you click on it

Currently, it only displays 0 and the buttons do nothing.

Your task is to make the buttons work: each click should decrease or increase value by 1
