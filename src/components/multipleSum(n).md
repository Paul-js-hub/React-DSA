The function *computeMultiplesSum(n)* should return **the sum of all the positive multiples** of the 3 or 5 or 7 strictly below *n*

As an example, for *n = 11* we get **3,5,6,7,9,10** as multiples and the sum of these multiples is is **40**.
Implement *computeMultiplesSum(n)*

**Constraints**
- 0 <= n < 1000

**hint**
A multiple of a number is a number that's the product of a given number and some other natural number.
